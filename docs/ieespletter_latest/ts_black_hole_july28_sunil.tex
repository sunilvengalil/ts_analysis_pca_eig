		Classification of timeseries as stochastic (noise-like) or non-stochastic (which has a well-defined structure), helps understand the underlying phenomenon, in domains as diverse as medicine, weather, finance etc. Traditional  integration-based methods (such as Correlation Integral (CI)-approach, Entropy, Mutual Information-based), are computationally expensive (atleast $O(N^2)$). In this work, we propose a computationally simple decomposition-based algorithm $O$(Linear in $N$) that utilizes two classical matrix-based methods to achieve stochastic vs non-stochastic classification. The  two legs of the proposed algorithm carry out complementary analysis. Temporal dynamics is studied using SVD-decomposition followed by topological analysis (Betti numbers), which produces the SVD-label. Parallely, temporal-ordering agnostic PCA analysis is carried out, and PCA-based features are computed. These features are fed to linear SVM to produce the PCA-label. The proposed methods have been applied to synthetic data, which are 48 distinct realisations of white noise, pink noise (stochastic timeseries), Logistic map and Lorentz system (non-stochastic timeseries), as proof of concept. The utility of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on astronomy data which are 12 categories of timeseries pertaining to blackhole \textit{GRS 1915 + 105}, obtained from RXTE satellite. For a given timeseries, if SVD-label and PCA-label both concur, then the corresponding spectral features are combined in order to determine the state of the blackhole. Else, it is deemed ``inconclusive" requiring further investigation. Comparison of obtained results with those in literature are also presented. It is found that out of 12 categories of timeseries considered, the state of the blackhole can be inferred in 11 categories.  However, it is more important to find the ``inconclusive" categories since investigations into them are expected to have long standing implications in astrophysics and otherwise.
		
		
		
		%Black hole is one of the fascinating,  however mysterious, astrophysical  objects. In order to identify it one has to look at its environment, often forming a disc-like structure. This disc, called accretion disc, evolves with time transiting from one state to another. For example, in one extreme regime it shows temperature dependent radiations making the disc geometrically thin, and in yet another extreme  regime of time span however radiation turns out to be temperature independent making the disc hot and geometrically thick.  Nevertheless, in general, accretion disc lies in  states intermediate between the two extremes. The present mission is to capture black hole states  explicitly using SVD and PCA based decompositions. In order to do that we rely on time series data of black hole \textit{GRS 1915 + 105} obtained from RXTE satellite. As a black hole cannot be seen directly, identifying its states accurately could help in characterizing its properties. Earlier time series  analysis based on Correlation Integral (CI) approaches, supplemented by theory, argued for four specific states. However there are caveats when data themselves are not free from noise and the  appropriate method for such an analysis itself is exploratory. Present interdisciplinary study aims at, on one hand,  to cross-verify the previous inference, on the other hand to identify, if any,  novel characteristics of black holes. In the experiments conducted it is found that among the proposed matrix based methods, SVD analysis concurs with CI based analysis on all the 12 classes of time series utilized. However, the inference using PCA based approach illustrates that one  class among the 12 turns out to be inconsistent with the other approaches. Investigation into these (in)consistencies  is expected to have long standing implications in astrophysics and otherwise.

	\section{Introduction}
	Several real-world phenomena are studied by collecting associated measurements over time, called as timeseries. Timeseries classification as stochastic (noise-like) or non-stochastic (which has a well-defined structure), is the first step in understanding the underlying physical phenomenon. A stochastic timeseries is defined as a sequence of realizations of a random variable which are independent. Standard stochastic signals such as white noise, pink noise, etc. exhibit characteristics such as nearly zero auto-correlation coefficients for all possible values of lags and a power spectral density that decays with frequency. The rate of decay determines the kind of noise.  Standard non-stochastic signals such as Logistic map (at growth rate = 4), Lorenz system result in timeseries that exhibit a well-defined structure, such as having a certain number of fixed points. The trajectory of the points taken  pair-wise, also exhibits a distinct pattern, called ``attractor behavior" \cite{CIGRacia}.
	
	% Computing parameters such as Correlation Dimension helps in revealing the underlying dynamics. 
	%However, for stochastic timeseries the Correlation Dimension never saturates. Hence if the goal of the study is to check if the timeseries is stochastic, then such computations must be avoided. 
	
	The most popular method to classify timeseries as stochastic or non-stochastic is Correlation Integral (CI)-based \cite{CIGRacia}. This approach determines correlation dimension, which explains the underlying dynamics of the phenomenon. It is computation-intensive, since the correlation dimension, for a fixed value of embedding dimension, is defined as the rate of change of CI with respect to the neighborhood radius, for values of radii that tend to zero. This computation is needed for different choices of embedding dimension. Besides, it is to be computed for  different ranges of neighbourhood radii. It is well-known that the value of correlation dimension does not saturate for a stochastic time series. Hence to establish if the timeseries is stochastic, this computation needs to be repeated for multiple values of embedding dimension, leading to higher computational complexity. Another popular set of approaches to determine if the timeseries is stochastic or non-stochastic, are based on Entropy. Entropy-based approaches \cite{splrecent, russian, Boaretto2021} utilize concepts of phase-space reconstruction, approximate entropy and recurrence plots. These approaches are also known to be computationally intensive since they involve computing parameters such as Lyapunov exponent.
	
	The problem of stochastic vs non-stochastic classification is important for one of the challenging problems in astrophysics, which could lead to the understanding of black holes. As a black hole cannot be seen directly, to identify it, one has to look for its environment forming a disc-like structure by the infalling matter called accretion disc. In this work, we focus on the black hole source \textit{GRS 1915+105}, which presents several intriguing facets. It has been divided into 12 different temporal categories: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\lambda$, $\kappa$, $\mu$, $\nu$, $\rho$, $\phi$, $\chi$ and $\theta$ \cite{Belloni2000}, with their respective distinct timeseries. One fundamental aspect of the understanding is to determine if the black hole source is stochastic or non-stochastic (implying turbulent nature of the system). There are studies reported that utilize CI-based approach to determine the characterization of this specific black hole data \cite{Mukhopadhyay2004, misra2006}. However, in this work, we propose to utilize classical matrix-based methods, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to understand the same data. It is useful to compare the inferences obtained using these distinct approaches; the implications of the (dis)similarities in inferences, if any, could lead to better understanding of the system.
	
	It is widely known that the true nature of the source is understood by studying both temporal and spectral features. Spectral features are impacted by dependence on temperature. If the source radiation is temperature dependent, it is called multicolour blackbody or ``diskbb" \cite{Shakura1973}. On the other hand, if it is independent of temperature, it exhibits power-law tail (``PL") \cite{chakrabarti1995,narayan1994}. The difference  lies in the fact that the former leads the underlying accretion disc around the black hole to be geometrically thin, while the latter leads to a geometrically thick disc. Studies in literature combine these observations into four possible blackhole states \cite{Adegoke2018}:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Non-stochastic and diskbb: Keplerian disc \cite{Shakura1973}.
		\item Non-stochastic and PL: Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF)  \cite{narayan1994}.
		\item Stochastic and diskbb: Slim disc \cite{Abramowicz1988}.
		\item Stochastic and PL: General Advective Accretion Flow (GAAF) \cite{chakrabarti1995, rajesh2010}.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Blackhole state identification is critically impacted by the nature of the timeseries. Hence it is imperative to analyze the data from diverse perspectives, to cross-check obtained inferences. This would help identify discrepancies, if any, that would need further investigation.


%	Interestingly, to quantify the properties of a black hole source, along with temporal features one has to look for spectral features as well, they together lead to the true nature of the source. If the source radiation is temperature dependent, it produces more like a blackbody radiation, namely multicolour blackbody or ``diskbb" \cite{Shakura1973}. On the other hand, the temperature independent radiation consists of a power-law tail, named as ``PL" \cite{chakrabarti1995,narayan1994}. While the former leads the underlying accretion disc around the black hole to be geometrically thin, the latter leads to a geometrically thick disc.
%	
%	In the present study, black hole states are determined by  classifying the given time series, which is photon count rate as a function of time,  as being either stochastic or non-stochastic. This classification is performed using classical matrix based methods, SVD and PCA.
%	However, the novelty of the study lies in (i) quantifying temporal complexity obtained by SVD decomposition, using topological techniques and (ii) utilizing features derived from PCA for classification. Based on our analysis there are four possible black hole states \cite{Adegoke2018}:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Non-stochastic and diskbb: Keplerian disc \cite{Shakura1973}.
%		\item Non-stochastic and PL: Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF)  \cite{narayan1994}.
%		\item Stochastic and diskbb: Slim disc \cite{Abramowicz1988}.
%		\item Stochastic and PL: General Advective Accretion Flow (GAAF) \cite{chakrabarti1995, rajesh2010}.

	\section{Related Work}
	Several groups have worked on distinguishing between stochastic and non-stochastic time series, in  studies of general non-linear systems, some of which are also applied to astronomy data. In CI-based approach, a $M \times K$ data matrix is constructed, where each column is an observation vector with $M$ components (embedding dimension), such that each of the components are independent. Each row contains $K$  consecutive samples taken from the time series. Correlation sum is then computed for various values of radius and embedding dimension, $M$, as explained in \cite{CIGRacia}. This method is known to be computationally expensive, $O(N^2M)$, where $N$ is the length of the timeseries, and $M$ is the embedding dimension.  Among entropy-based approaches a recent study explored the idea of utilizing Permutation Entropy (PE) to determine the complexity measure of a timeseries \cite{Bandt2002}. This idea was utilized in \cite{Boaretto2021}, where PE was used to parameterize a given time series  followed by classification using  Neural Network. PE was used to determine the measure of resemblance with known stochastic signals such as pink noise. The claim was that for non-stochastic signals the deviation of the parameter is relatively large as compared to that of the parameter of a stochastic signal. The authors report results on synthetic signals such as various types of noise, chaotic systems as well as emperical datasets such as human gait data and Heart rate variability data. This approach, however, assumes prior knowledge on the length of ordinal sequences.

	Apart from CI-based and entropy-based approaches, there are also reported works that utilize graph-based methods and dictionary-based methods. In \cite{lacasa2010}, the authors have utilized the horizontal visibility algorithm in order to distinguish between stochastic and non-stochastic processes. A recent work, reported in \cite{Silva2022}, mapped timeseries into  graphs and computed various topological properties, which they called \textit{NetF}, capturing  measures such as centrality, distance, connectivity etc. PCA was applied on the \textit{NetF} feature matrix and clustering was performed on the principal components. The authors illustrated the method on diverse datasets such as insect wing beat, timeseries obtained from electric devices etc. In \cite{Brunton2016}, the authors combined the idea of sparsity and machine learning with non-linear dynamical systems, in order to determine the governing dynamics. Sparse regression was used to determine the fewest terms in the equations that govern the dynamics of the phenomenon. The authors utilize the method on diverse scenarios such as oscillators, the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle, etc. The user-defined dictionary of basis functions consists of well-known functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions and exponentials. However, the optimal choice of dictionary for a specific choice of problem remains a challenge.
	
	In this work, we propose to utilize computationally simple classical matrix based methods which do not require any assumptions about the underlying phenomenon.
	
	\section{Proposed Method}
	
	In this work, we propose an algorithm with two parallel legs as shown in Fig. \ref{blockfig}, each of which perform complementary analysis, in order to determine if the given timeseries is stochastic or non-stochastic. They are 1) SVD decomposition followed by topological analysis (using Betti number descriptors) and 2) PCA derived features followed by SVM classification. If the labels obtained using the two approaches concur, the corresponding label is retained; Else the result is declared ``Inconclusive". Proof of concept on synthetic signals is presented below. In the following sections, $z_1, z_2 \mathellipsis z_N$ denotes the time series of length $N$
	
	\subsection{SVD based approach}
	In this approach, we form uncorrelated observation vectors from the raw time series data  by choosing an appropriate value of embedding dimension, $M$, as in \cite{misra2006} using autocorrelation plot. Data matrix, $D$ given in Equation \ref{eqn:dmatrix}, is formed with each row  as the  time shifted version of the original time series.
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dmatrix}
		D= \begin{bmatrix} z_1  & \mathellipsis & z_k \\
			   z_{1 + \tau} &  \mathellipsis & z_{K + \tau}\\
		       z_{1 + 2\tau} &  \mathellipsis &z_{K + 2\tau} \\
			   \mathellipsis \\
			   z_{1 + (M-1)\tau} & \mathellipsis & z_{K + (M-1)}\tau)\\
		\end{bmatrix}
		\end{equation}
	Here $z(1), z(2), \mathellipsis, z(K)$ are $K$ consecutive samples of the time series. The time shift, $\tau$, is chosen to be large enough so that each column can be viewed as a different observation vector of the same time-evolving phenomenon. Temporal dynamics is understood by utilizing the right singular vectors of the SVD decomposition of $D$ as given in equation (\ref{eqn:svd}) below. We consider the top two right singular vectors, E1 and E2, for our analysis.
	\begin{equation}
		D = U \Sigma V^T.
		\label{eqn:svd}
	\end{equation}
	We observe the topology of the plot E1 vs E2. For non-stochastic time series this plot is expected to show a specific pattern (attractor behavior, where the plot follows a structured trajectory leaving  well-defined voids). On the other hand, E1 Vs E2 plot for a stochastic time series, appears as a single blob without any voids. The toplogy of the E1 vs E2 plot is  captured using Betti numbers \cite{jmlr}. Betti number descriptor for a $d$-dimensional manifold is a vector of $d$ integers which is represented as $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1 \mathellipsis \beta_{d-1})$. Here $\beta_{0}$ is the number of blobs (connected components) and $\beta_k$ represents number of $k$-dimensional holes for $k>0$.  The E1 vs E2 plots are 2-D manifolds, which are described by  $\beta=(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}$). Here, we utilize $L1$-norm of the $\beta$ descriptor vector, $\|\beta\|_1$, for classification.  For a stochastic time series the values of $\beta_{0}$  is expected to be 1 (single connected component) and that of $\beta_1$ is expected to be 0 (no holes). Hence for a stochastic time series, $\|\beta\|_1 = 1$. However, for a non-stochastic time series, we observe that the value of $\beta_{0}$ can be greater than 1 (can have one or more connected components) and the value of $\beta_1$ is always greater than 0 (presence of holes) due to the attractor behavior. Hence for a non-stochastic timeseries $\|\beta\|_1 > 1$.
	
	\subsection{PCA Based approach}
	
	PCA  decomposition is carried out to infer if the given time series possesses a dominant orientation or not. This is computed by hierarchally splitting the timeseries into two halves, and computing the covariance matrix of these split observations. The eigenvalues of this $2 \times 2$ covariance matrix will show one of the signatures: If the data indeed show any dominant direction (as in non-stochastic timeseries), then the larger eigenvalue will be significantly greater than the other. This will lead to a large eigen value ratio. On the other hand, if the data do not show any dominant direction (as in stochastic time series), then the two eigenvalues of the covariance matrix will be comparable. This will lead to small eigen value ratio. This observation is utilized in devising features for stochastic Vs non-stochastic classification. The steps are outlined as below.
	
	For a time series consisting of $N$ values  $z_1, z_2 \mathellipsis z_N$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Split the series into two halves $(z_1, z_2 \mathellipsis z_{\floor*{\frac{N}{2}}})$ and $(z_{\floor*{\frac{N}{2}} + 1}, \mathellipsis z_N)$.
		\item Compute covariance matrix, $C$,  by treating the samples in two halves as $\floor*{\frac{N}{2}}$ observations of 2-D vectors.
		\item Find eigenvalues of $C$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$; the eigenvalue ratio is computed as  $\lambda_1/\lambda_2$ where $\lambda_1 \ > \lambda_2$ (eigenvalues of a covariance matrix are real).
	\end{itemize}
	If the eigenvalue ratio for an interval is greater than a value of threshold, $Th$ (computing optimal value of $Th$ is described in subsection \ref{compute_threshold} below ), the interval is further split into two sub-intervals of equal size.  Subsequently, the eigenvalue ratio for each sub-interval is computed. The process is repeated as long as the length of the sub-interval is greater than a predefined number of samples (here taken as 100).
	For a fixed value of $Th$, the following features are derived
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{V}ariance of \textbf{E}igenvalue \textbf{R}atio (\textbf{VER}): This is the variance of the eigenvalue ratios of covariance matrices across sub-intervals in the entire time series: $VER=var(e_1,e_2,\mathellipsis e_N)$ where $e_i$  denotes the eigenvalue ratio for sample  $i$ . This measure captures the spread in values of the eigenvalue ratio, reflecting the presence or absence of patterns in a timeseries.
		\item \textbf{A}rea \textbf{U}nder the \textbf{E}igenvalue \textbf{R}atio curve (\textbf{AUER}): This measure captures the area under the curve of the eigenvalue ratio for the entire time series computed using equation $AUER=\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_{i}t_{i}$ where $t_i$ is the length of interval $i$. High values of this measure indicate that relatively higher eigenvalue ratios prevail for long time intervals, capturing structure in a timeseries.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{ Computing optimal value of threshold $Th$} \label{compute_threshold}

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{threshold.jpg}
		\caption{Plot of Silhoutte score vs eigenratio threshold. Maximum Silhoutte score value, which indicates the best clustering, is obtained at a threshold of 9.}
		\label{sill}
	\end{figure}


	In order to arrive at the optimal value of $Th$, we observe  the plot of the Silhoutte score of K-Means clustering, with $K=2$ (stochastic and non-stochastic), performed using the above feature set, as a function of the threshold value. The value of the threshold that results in the best Silhoutte clustering score is taken as $Th$. This process is illustrated in the Silhoutte score plot shown in Fig. \ref{sill}. For the time series considered here for illustration, it is evident from the plot that the best clustering is obtained at threshold value 9, resulting in the maximum value of Silhoutte score. Hence we use the corresponding $Th = 9$ to arrive at the optimal hierarchical splitting and subsequent computing of the devised PCA-based features, VER and AUER.

	\subsection{Proof of Concept on Synthetic Data}
	The proposed approaches have been applied to standard synthetic signals. For stochastic class of signals, white noise and pink noise are considered; for non-stochastic class of signals, Lorenz system and Logistic map (for growth rate = 4) are considered.
	
	SVD-Decomposition based technique : The SVD decomposition of the data is computed, followed by the plot of the top two right singular vectors. This plot is utilized to determine the Betti descriptors. The plot in Fig. \ref{e1e2plots}(a) corresponds to the E1 vs E2 plot for a realization of white noise, which is known to be stochastic. The plot shows one single blob implying Betti descriptor of (1 0), $\|\beta\|_1 = 1$. As discussed before, this timeseries is labelled as stochastic. On the other hand, the plot in Fig. \ref{e1e2plots}(b) corresponds to the E1 vs E2 plot of a realization of Lorentz system, which is known to be non-stochastic.  The plot shows two distinct voids, implying Betti descriptor to be (1 2), $\|\beta\|_1 = 3$, due to which the timeseries is non-stochastic. This inference mechanism has been utilized on real data described in section \ref{rnd}.
	The order of computations needed is mainly determined by the complexity of SVD Decomposition (For M x N matrix = $O(M^2N)$, which is linear in $N$).

		PCA-Decomposition based technique: PCA-based features (i) VER and (ii) AUER,  are computed for the considered synthetic signals which are 24 different realizations of white noise and Logistic map (growth rate = 4). The scatter plot of these features is shown Fig \ref{scatterplot} below. Since the dynamic range of values for the features VER and AUER is large, we use log scale for the scatter plot. We observe the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item VER: For a stochastic signal since the variation in the eigenvalue ratios is typically small, the computed variance across the values is also small. On the other hand, for a non-stochastic signal, since the eigenvalue ratios occupy diverse values, VER is typically high.
		\item AUER: For a stochastic time series, since the eigenvalue ratios  are small across the entire span, the value of AUER is also small. However, for a non-stochastic signal, the eigenvalue ratios remain high for longer time intervals. Hence the value of AUER is significantly higher.
	\end{itemize}


	The plot makes it evident that in this feature space the two classes of timeseries, stochastic and non-stochastic, become linearly separable. Hence a linear SVM classifier is utilized. For training the SVM, computed features from white noise and Logistic map are utilized. For validating the trained SVM, 12 realizations of pink noise and Lorentz system are used. The classification on all 12 realizations of pink noise, yields the label stochastic, and the classification label for Lorentz system is obtained as non-stochastic, leading to perfect validation accuracy. This trained SVM is used to classify real data as described in section \ref{rnd}
	
	The order of computations needed can be split into 1) computations for covariance matrix (which involves computing $X^TX$  where $X$ is of dimensions $ {\floor*{\frac{N}{2}}} \times 2$ : $O(N)$ ), 2) computing eigen values of $2\times 2$ matrix which takes constant time and 3) number of iterations  (For N-length timeseries = assuming maximum number of splits, (log N)). Since final SVM 2-class classification step also takes constant time, the overall time complexity of PCA based approach is $O(NlogN)$

	\section{Results and Discussion} \label{rnd}
	In this section, we present the real data used, results obtained using proposed approaches and comparison with results in literature. All codes and results are available at the link \href{https://github.com/sunilvengalil/ts_analysis_pca_eig}{https://github.com/sunilvengalil/ts\_analysis\_pca\_eig}
	
	\subsection{Real Data}
	The proposed approaches are illustrated on the publicly available data of \textit{GRS 1915 + 105} taken from website \cite{xte}. 12 categories of time series are utilized from the available data. All these time series are re-sampled with a sampling interval of 0.1 second. The length of the time series considered across the 12 categories vary from a minimum of TODO to a maximum of TODO. These datasets  were  also used in the work reported in \cite{Adegoke2018}, where the authors use CI based approaches, leading us to be able to compare our obtained results with theirs.

	\subsection{Results of SVD based analysis}
	
	%From SVD decomposition of the data matrix, we pick up the top 2 right singular vectors (E1, E2) corresponding to the temporal dynamics and plot E1 vs E2 for each time series.

The Betti number descriptors for each of the E1-E2 plots are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:results} under the column Betti descriptors. In order to infer the label of the time series from the Betti descriptors, We use the following strategy. Betti descriptor $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1)$. We use the L1-norm of $\beta$. If $\lvert \beta \rvert \gt 1$ then the time series is classified as non-stochastic else the time series is stochastic.
	
	The data matrix $D$ is constructed with $K=5000$ columnns. From SVD decomposition of the data matrix, we plot the top 2 right singular vectors (E1 vs E2) to understand the temporal dynamics for each time series. For classification, we use the $L1$-norm of the Betti descriptor, $\beta$, $\|\beta\|_1$. If $\|\beta\|_1 = 1$, the time series is classified as stochastic, else the time series is non-stochastic. The obtained values of $\|\beta\|_1$, along with the classification labels have been tabulated in Table \ref{tab:results_1}.

	\subsection {SVD Vs PCA approach} SVD decomposition is utilized to study the temporal dynamics in the timeseries considered. This is in contrast to the PCA approach which does not consider the temporal ordering of data. Hence each of the approaches follows a perspective that is complementary to the other. Utilizing them both together to obtain inferences that concur makes the study reliable. In case of non-concurrence, it is clear that the problem would need further investigations.

\subsection{Comparison of Blackhole state Inference}
Comparison of Blackhole state inference using proposed approaches as against CI based approach \cite{Adegoke2018} is shown in Table \ref{tab:results_1}. We observe that results obtained using SVD based analysis are consistent with CI based results for all the 12 categories of time series. However, with the PCA based approach the inference for  $\delta$ time series is not consistent with the other two approaches. According to the CI based analysis $\delta$ turns out to be in between states slim disc and GAAF \cite{Adegoke2018}. However, the present analysis shows that $\delta$ falls in between ADAF and Keplerian disc.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	Exploring different techniques in order to have a conclusive inference for black hole systems turns out to be indispensable. We propose an algorithm that utilizes two separate legs (SVD and PCA decomposition), each of which determines an independent label for a timeseries, using complementary approaches. SVD decomposition studies the temporal dynamics, while PCA decomposition is agnostic to temporal ordering. If the two independent labels concur, then the blackhole state is identified by combining with available spectral features. This is illustrated on \textit{GRS 1915+105} black hole using the time series obtained from \textit{RXTE} satellite data. We compare inferences of the CI based approach with those obtained using the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm was applied on 12 categories of timeseries, where concurrence was obtained on 11 of them. Based on our analysis, we are able to identify two extreme temporal dynamical classes of accretion around black holes.
	
%	 matrix based methods. Of the 12 categories of time series analysed, a mismatch is observed in the PCA based inference of only one class, while all other classes concur. Since SVD approach studies temporal dynamics, and PCA analysis is agnostic to temporal ordering, the two approaches together are required for unambiguous inference.
	%Several real-world phenomena are studied by collecting associated measurements over time, popularly called as timeseries. Understanding the phenomenon, typically begins by determining if the timeseries is stochastic (noise-like) or non-stochastic (which has a well-defined structure). Stochastic timeseries may be seen as noise, while non-stochastic timeseries could reveal more about the associated physcial phenomenon. This problem of stochastic vs non-stochastic classification runs across domains such as weather, finance, agriculture, astronomy, etc.  For a specific problem in astronomy, in the context of data obtained from the RXTE satellite, the problem of stochastic vs non-stochastic classification can help in identifying states of the black hole, \textit{GRS 1915 + 105}. The most-popular method for stochastic vs non-stochastic classification follows Correlation Integral (CI) based approach, which is computationally expensive. In this study, we propose two computationally simple matrix-based approaches, for classifying a timeseries as stochastic or non-stochastic, which are : (a) SVD-based technique followed by topological analysis (b) PCA-based technique. The proposed methods have been applied to 12 categories of timeseries pertaining to blackhole \textit{GRS 1915 + 105}, obtained from RXTE satellite. Comparisons of obtained results with those in literature are also presented. The order of computational complexity using the proposed approaches is reduced by a factor of TOBEDONExxxxTOBEDONE, as compared to the current gold-standard CI-based approach. It is found that among the proposed matrix based methods, SVD analysis concurs with CI based analysis on all 12 categories of time series utilized. However, the inference using PCA based approach illustrates that one class among the 12 turns out to be inconsistent with the other approaches. Investigation into these (in)consistencies  is expected to have long standing implications in astrophysics and otherwise.
